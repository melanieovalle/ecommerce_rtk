# E-commer Web App

Developed a basic e-commerce platform using React and Redux. The Web App feautures a product list with an “Add to Cart” button for each item, enabling users to view and manage items added to the cart, and removing items.
Utilized the useDispatch and useSelector hooks to interact with Redux, providing global data accessibility. It ensures seamless state management throughout the application, enhancing user experience and scalability.

Adapted from the IBM coding template.
